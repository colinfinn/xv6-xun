问题1：Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
答：usertrap函数调用了syscall。
问题2：What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent? (Hint: look user/initcode.S, the first user program xv6 starts.)
答：在gdb打印结构体p只有trapframe的地址，要获取a7,需要
在gdb显示结构体trapframe,
p /x *(struct trapframe*)0x87f74000,a7的值为0x7。
查看user/initcode.S中有一行li a7, SYS_exec，将其存放到a7，
这里的SYS_exec是syscall.h里的宏定义，代表了系统调用号。
What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
位于用户模式
